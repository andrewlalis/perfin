## About Perfin

Perfin is a desktop app built with Java 21 and JavaFX. It's intended to be used
by individuals to track their finances across multiple accounts (savings,
checking, credit, etc.).

Because the app lives and works entirely on your local computer, you can rest
assured that your data remains completely private.

Currently, the application is still a work-in-progress, and is not yet suitable
for actual usage with your real financial data, so stay tuned for updates.
