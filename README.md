## About Perfin

Perfin is a desktop app built with Java 21 and JavaFX, using the SQLite3
database for most data storage. It's intended to be used by individuals to
track their finances across multiple accounts (savings, checking, credit, etc.).

Because the app lives and works entirely on your local computer, you can rest
assured that your data remains completely private.
