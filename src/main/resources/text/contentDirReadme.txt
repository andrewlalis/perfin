This is your Perfin profile's content directory.

It contains all the files and other large content that you've added to your
profile, including but not limited to transaction attachments (receipts,
invoices, etc.), bank statements, or portfolio exports. These files are usually
managed by the Perfin app through in-app actions, but you're also welcome to
browse them directly, or even delete files you no longer want stored.

Here's an overview of where you can find everything:

- transaction-attachments/
This folder contains all files you've attached to transactions you've created.
Within this folder, you'll see a series of sub-folders organized by the date
at which attachments were uploaded, and in side each date folder, you'll find
one folder for each transaction. For example, your folder might look like this:

  my-profile/
    content/
      transaction-attachments/
        2023-12-28/
          tx-2/
            receipt.png
          tx-3/
            invoice.pdf
        2024-01-04/
          tx-4/
