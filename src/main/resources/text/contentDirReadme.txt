This is your Perfin profile's content directory.

It contains all the files and other large content that you've added to your
profile, including but not limited to transaction attachments (receipts,
invoices, etc.), bank statements, or portfolio exports. These files are usually
managed by the Perfin app through in-app actions, but you're also welcome to
browse them directly, or even delete files you no longer want stored.
