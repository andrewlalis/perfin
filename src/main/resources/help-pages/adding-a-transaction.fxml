        ## Adding a Transaction ##
        When you're adding a new transaction to your *Perfin* profile, there are
        some details that you should be aware of.

        # Timestamp #
        The timestamp is the date and time at which the transaction took place,
        in your local time zone. Generally, it's encouraged to set this as the
        real timestamp at which the transaction took place (the time shown on a
        receipt or invoice, for example), rather than the timestamp provided by
        your financial institution once the payment has been processed.
        --
        It's formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`, so for example, November 14th,
        2015 at 4:15pm would be written as `2015-11-14 16:15:00`. You can omit
        the seconds if you like, however.
        --
        Also note that you may not enter timestamps from the future; it just
        doesn't make sense to do so.

        # Amount #
        The total amount of the transaction, as a positive decimal value. This
        is the final amount which you've paid or received, including any tax,
        tips, or transaction fees.

        # Currency #
        The currency of the transaction. This should be the same currency as the
        account(s) that the transaction is linked to.

        # Linked Debit and Credit Accounts #
        Every transaction, for it to mean something, needs to be linked to one
        (or sometimes two) of your accounts. A transaction's impact on an
        account depends on whether the transaction is being treated as a **Debit**
        or a **Credit** on the account.
        --
        The account linked as **Debit** is the one whose assets will
        **increase** as a result of the transaction. Some common examples of
        transactions with debit-linked accounts include deposits to checking
        or savings accounts, or refunds to credit cards.
        --
        The account linked as **Credit** is the one whose assets will
        **decrease** as a result of the transaction. Some common examples of
        transactions with credit-linked accounts include payments or purchases
        with a checking or savings account, or a credit card.
        --
        In short, if your account is *gaining money*, link it under **debit**.
        If your account is *losing money*, link it under **credit**.
        --
        For transfers between two accounts that are both tracked in *Perfin*,
        the *sending* account should be linked under **credit**, and the
        *receiving* account under **debit**.

        # Additional Attributes #
        The *vendor*, *category*, *tags*, and *line items* fields are all
        optional fields that can be set to add extra context to your
        transaction. The **vendor** tells you from which business you bought
        something, for example. The **category** helps you group similar
        transactions so that you can get an accurate breakdown of your spending
        and earnings. With **tags**, you can add custom text tags to your
        transaction, sort of like social media's "hashtag" phenomenon.
        --
        **Line items** can be used to specify in more detail what was bought or sold
        in a transaction. For example, you bought a new computer and some
        accessories at an electronics store. You can record the exact purchase
        price of the computer as a line-item in the transaction, alongside the
        added costs of accessories and taxes.
        --
        **Note: Line items are not yet available for usage.**

        # Attachments #
        Often, you'll have a receipt, invoice, bank statement, or some other
        document which acts as proof of a transaction. You can attach files to
        a transaction to save those files with it, as a reference. The files
        will be copied to your *Perfin* profile.
